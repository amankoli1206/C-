Data Types in C++ are Mainly Divided into 3 Types: 
1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

* Integer
* Character
* Boolean
* Floating Point
* Double Floating Point
* Valueless or Void
* Wide Character
2. Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 

* Function
* Array
* Pointer
* Reference
3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:  

* Class
* Structure
* Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined Datatype
Primitive Data Types
Integer: The keyword used for integer data types is int. Integers typically require 4 bytes of memory space and range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.  
Character: Character data type is used for storing characters. The keyword used for the character data type is char. Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.  
Boolean: Boolean data type is used for storing Boolean or logical values. A Boolean variable can store either true or false. The keyword used for the Boolean data type is bool. 
Floating Point: Floating Point data type is used for storing single-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the floating-point data type is float. Float variables typically require 4 bytes of memory space. 
Double Floating Point: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the double floating-point data type is double. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space. 
void: Void means without any value. void data type represents a valueless entity. A void data type is used for those function which does not return a value. 
Wide Character: Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has a size greater than the normal 8-bit data type. Represented by wchar_t. It is generally 2 or 4 bytes long.
sizeof() operator: sizeof() operator is used to find the number of bytes occupied by a variable/data type in computer memory.
